Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo works, however if the demo autodetects the card
  and you accept without going into the sound card settings,
  the demo has a terrible time keeping audio playback going.

  The reason it has problems is that the demo's Sound Blaster
  detection routine has a race condition with it's IRQ detection
  routine.

  Pseudocode:

            Hook IRQ 3, 5, and 7. Interrupt handlers will write their
            IRQ value to a memory location when executed.

            Issue DSP command 0xF2 (Request 8-bit IRQ)

            Immediately after sending the DSP command, zero the
            memory location the IRQ handler would write to, in preparation
            of the interrupt.

  Problem:

            DOSBox/DOSBox-X IRQ emulation is immediate or near-immediate,
            while real hardware is too slow for the IRQ to hit the CPU in
            the time it takes to go from OUT DX,AL to MOV CS:[IRQnum],0.

            The result is that in DOSBox-X, the DSP command triggers the
            IRQ immediately, then the demo overwrites the IRQ value written
            with zero.

            You can tell that this happened by the demo's menu screen
            that will show correct sound card type, base I/O and DMA channel
            but will show an IRQ setting of 0.

Update:
- A slight delay between IRQ signal and interrupting the CPU has been added
  to DOSBox-X, which fixes the issue.
