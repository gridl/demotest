Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo does not respond to keyboard input during credits [FIXED]

Bugs:
- If DOSBox-X allows keyboard exit to DOS, demo does not unhook it's
  music routine. Music continues to play from the DOS prompt, and
  when you run something else in DOS that overwrites that memory,
  the system crashes.
