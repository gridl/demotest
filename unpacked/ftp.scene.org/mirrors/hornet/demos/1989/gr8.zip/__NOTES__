Why the demo failed the test:
- "Future Crew" logo at the bottom is missing. Logo appears on REAL HARDWARE (Test 1/1)
- Running the cycle count too low causes VGA emulation to complain about rapid switching between EGA/CGA mode (?)
Real hardware notes:
- There should be a "Future Crew" logo on the bottom half of the screen.
  Confirmed: Toshiba 1997 Pentium Laptop, Chips & Tech SVGA chipset, 800x600 LCD display.
