Why the demo failed the test:
- Last demo part shows nothing on the screen (will mark PASS if this is behavior on REAL HARDWARE).
- Exits to DOS with the same blank screen (will mark PASS if this is behavior on REAL HARDWARE).
Real hardware:
- Toshiba laptop 1997: Crashed, hung
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo runs normally, then crashes/hangs (with audible beeps from the 486SX unit).
