Why the demo failed the test:
- Always crashes at one point with divide by zero.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA. Palette errors during "This demo is compatible with Tseng/Trident", render errors during animation. The ship gets garbled at one part in the same way that divide by zero crashes in DOSBox-X.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS, ET4000: Some flicker during 3D maze (as if bad page flipping). GUS music works (IRQ 11, DMA 5). Does not crash during space part (something about a 486SX/33MHz?)
