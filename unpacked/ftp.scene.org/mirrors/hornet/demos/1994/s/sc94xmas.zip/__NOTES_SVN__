Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo doesn't seem to respond to keyboard during
  main part and therefore there doesn't seem to be
  a way to exit to DOS.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, OPL3-SAx (Sound Blaster Pro): Sound works, does not respond to keyboard.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Sound works, does not respond to keyboard, takes a long time (486SX/33MHz?) to display anything.
