Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo ALMOST exits normally, waiting on INT 16h, except that it keeps it's own keyboard handler hooked to IRQ 1 and therefore INT 16h can't read anything.
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997 Sound Blaster: No music (GUS only). Returned to DOS just fine.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: GUS music works. Runs just fine (slowly on 486SX/33MHz). Exits to last message, but does not respond to keyboard.
