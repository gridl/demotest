Why the demo failed the test:
- Sound Blaster Pro support starts playback then leaves it to run through
  garbage data in RAM, while hung at the sound card selection menu.
  REAL HARDWARE shows that Sound Blaster Pro support works, at least against SBPro compatible hardware (see below)
Notes:
- If you select "Sound Blaster 16" you must specify the 16-bit DMA channel (usually 5)
  or the demo will not play any music.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba 1997 Pentium with SBPro compatible OPL3-SAx: Sound Blaster Pro support works perfectly fine, does not hang as described above. However the 3D maze runs too fast, and exhibits Mode X tearlines.
