Why the demo failed the test:
- Sound Blaster Pro support starts playback then leaves it to run through
  garbage data in RAM, while hung at the sound card selection menu.
- Gravis Ultrasound support appears to get stuck waiting for something.
Notes:
- If you select "Sound Blaster 16" you must specify the 16-bit DMA channel (usually 5)
  or the demo will not play any music.
