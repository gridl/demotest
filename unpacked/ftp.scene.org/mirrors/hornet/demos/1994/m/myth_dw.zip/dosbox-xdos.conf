# ^ DEMO BUG: The Gravis Ultrasound support code uploads samples to the GUS
#   via DMA, but at some point accidentally clears the DMA ENABLE bit on the
#   GUS, then attempts to start a DMA transfer and hangs waiting for a DMA
#   terminal count event from the GUS that never arrives. This hack fixes
#   the issue.
