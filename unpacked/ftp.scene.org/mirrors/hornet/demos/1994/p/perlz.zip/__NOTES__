Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo runs through "burning down" the pot leaf,
  then stays at a black screen. It's not clear
  if the demo is supposed to do that, or if the
  demo does that on real hardware anyway, or
  if something is wrong with emulation.

  But, hitting SPACE at the end will drop back
  to DOS.
