Why the demo failed the test:
- Sound Blaster Pro support tries to use SB16 commands. Is the demo mis-detecting the DSP version? Will mark pass if the same happens on REAL HARDWARE.
! PLEASE TEST THIS ON REAL HARDWARE
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997 (Sound Blaster Pro compatible): Audio does not play (as if unable to process IRQ). Possibly same issues.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Sound Blaster Pro setting doesn't work (well, it is a Pro Audio Spectrum). 486SX/33MHz
