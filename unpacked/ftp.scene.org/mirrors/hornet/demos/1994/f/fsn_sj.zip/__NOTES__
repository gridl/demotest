Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo crashes midway through, with blank screen. Music keeps playing though. It does respond to hitting ESC on the keyboard to exit to DOS.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: Runs fine
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo hangs midway through, at rectangle and bouncing "ball", music keeps playing. It does however respond to the keyboard so it is possible to hit ESC to drop to DOS.
