Demo bugs:
- When the demo probes the Sound Blaster IRQ, it uses a software timeout
  (I/O delay) that can fail to detect the IRQ if it takes longer than
  500ns for it's IRQ handler to receive the signal.
- If the demo cannot detect the Sound Blaster IRQ, then it will take
  IRQ 0 (the timer interrupt) as the Sound Blaster IRQ, which will then
  result in incorrect music playback.
