PC speaker output works! (but, I did once hear an odd variation in volume).

Demo is VERY TOUCHY about sensing the space bar. Tap it very lightly, or the demo will skip through many parts at once and dump back to DOS.

This demo also proudly shows a schematic to a stereo LPT DAC output for your parallel port.

You can hit SPACEBAR during the initial prompt for the PC speaker, or type "378" <ENTER> to hear LPT DAC music.
