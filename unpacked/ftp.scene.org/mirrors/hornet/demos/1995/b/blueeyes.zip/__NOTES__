Why the demo failed the test:
- Sound Blaster support crashes if about 600KB of memory is available
! PLEASE TEST ON REAL HARDWARE
TEST RESULTS:
- FAIL. Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA Laptop with Sound Blaster Pro compatible. Demo crashes just after morphing fractals, just as it does in DOSBox-X.
- FAIL. S3 VIRGE PCI with Sound Blaster 16. "Sound Blaster" or "Sound Blaster Pro" selection hard-crashes at startup.
