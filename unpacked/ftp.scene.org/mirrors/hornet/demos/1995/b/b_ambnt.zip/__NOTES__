Notes:
- Not sure if demo is rendering correctly the display, real hardware testing seems to indicate it is
Real hardware:
- Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA: Inconclusive, garbled display (even worse than DOSBox-X) (two times)
- S3 VIRGE SVGA: PASS, same visual effect at DOSBox-X (though no logo, perhaps capture card cut it off?)
- COMP-Old486y91, Tseng ET4000: PASS, same visual effect as DOSBox-X (though no logo, perhaps capture card cut it off?)
