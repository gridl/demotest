Why the demo failed the test:
- Not sure if demo is rendering correctly the display
! PLEASE TEST THIS ON REAL HARDWARE

TEST RESULTS:
- Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA: Inconclusive, garbled display (even worse than DOSBox-X) (two times)
- S3 VIRGE SVGA: PASS, same visual effect at DOSBox-X (though no logo, perhaps capture card cut it off?)
