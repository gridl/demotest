Why the demo failed the test:
- Gravis Ultrasound support will always complain about insufficient memory, no matter what. Will mark PASS if this occurs on REAL HARDWARE.
! PLEASE TEST ON REAL HARDWARE
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, Sound Blaster Pro: Apparently 622KB conventional and 32MB extended is "not enough memory to load sound module"
