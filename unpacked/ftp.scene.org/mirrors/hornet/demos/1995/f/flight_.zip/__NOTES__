Notes:
- Demo is wrapped in a wrapper that has self-modifying code and it is VERY PARTICULAR about memory address and CPU speed
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: Hangs at startup, does not run
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: It starts up, detects GUS, runs (something about 486SX/33MHz?), exits to DOS normally. Hm....
