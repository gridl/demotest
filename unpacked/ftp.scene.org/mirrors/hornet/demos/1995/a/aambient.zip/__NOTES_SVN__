Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo kills it's own music routines midway through, leaving "stuck notes". Will mark as PASS if this occurs on REAL HARDWARE
! PLEASE TEST ON REAL HARDWARE
Real hardware:
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: GUS music works. Music eventually gets stuck, though later than in DOSBox-X.
