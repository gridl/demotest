Why the demo failed the test:
- Somehow, the demo is triggering a 14Mhz dot clock, and setting a text
  mode with a refresh rate of 24Hz, which any sane VGA monitor would not
  support.
Real hardware:
- 1997 Toshiba laptop (Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA): Becomes a sort of odd 400-line 84Hz mode, with glitches (or the glitches could be my capture card)
