Why the demo failed the test:
- The demo runs at half the frame rate that it does in DOSBox SVN for some reason IF Gravis Ultrasound is selected.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba laptop 1997 Yamaha OPL3-SAx Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA: Sound Blaster Pro playback OK. Color palette messed up in 3D city scene, fire, and plasma effect, end moving fractals, other parts.
