Why the demo failed the test:
- Leaves keyboard unresponsive when exiting to DOS
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: Failed to detect Sound Blaster (as it does in DOSBox-X). Keyboard remains responsive on exit.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Detects GUS, runs normally, keyboard remains responsive on exit.
