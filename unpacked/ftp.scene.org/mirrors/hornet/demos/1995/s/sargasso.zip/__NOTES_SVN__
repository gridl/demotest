Why the demo failed the test:
- The glitch graphics in one part call to question whether that is intentional or not. Will mark PASS if it occurs on real hardware.
! PLEASE TEST ON REAL HARDWARE
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, Chips & Tech 65554, no GUS, OPL3-SAx (Sound Blaster Pro): Same glitch graphics
