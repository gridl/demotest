Why the demo failed the test:
- Endless reboot cycle
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: Hangs, crashes at startup
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Runs, prompts for GUS, GUS music plays, runs normally, exits to DOS normally (something about 486SX/33MHz?). During testing, as prompted by the demo, I hit '3' to speed up the text. There's a lot of text...
