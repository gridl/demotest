Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo seems to rely on something the VGA emulation isn't offering in it's 320x400x256 mode, perhaps the 128KB A000 mapping. Will mark as PASS if this occurs on real hardware.
! PLEASE TEST THIS ON REAL HARDWARE
Real Hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: "Sample too big, out of memory" on a DOS setup with 622KB of conventional memory free.
