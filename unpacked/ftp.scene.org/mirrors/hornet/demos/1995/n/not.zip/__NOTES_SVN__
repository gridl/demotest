Notes:
- Demo seems to rely on something the VGA emulation isn't offering in it's 320x400x256 mode, perhaps the 128KB A000 mapping typical of Tseng ET4000.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: "Sample too big, out of memory" on a DOS setup with 622KB of conventional memory free.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS, ET4000: GUS playback works. Does not have wraparound issue. 320x400 rotating phong item stays on the top half.
