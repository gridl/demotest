Why the demo failed the test:
- There is a part mid-demo that shows an "I" half-inverted, which
  scrolls up then leaves a blank screen for an extended amount of time.
  Will mark PASS if this happens on real hardware.
! PLEASE TEST THIS DEMO ON REAL HARDWARE
TEST RESULTS:
- PASS: Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA (Same "I" result, however mirrored rotozoomer is also garbled)
- PASS: S3 VIRGE PCI SVGA (Same "I" result)
