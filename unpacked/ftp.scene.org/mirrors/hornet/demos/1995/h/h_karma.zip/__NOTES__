Notes:
- If insufficient memory: Demo get stuck on the "ball with spring" part, does not exit to DOS, music stops.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop, 1997: Unable to initialize Sound Blaster output, hangs at startup
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Starts normally, detects GUS, uses GUS. Surprisingly good frame rate considering 486SX/33MHz. Does not get stuck at "ball with spring" part. Exits normally.
