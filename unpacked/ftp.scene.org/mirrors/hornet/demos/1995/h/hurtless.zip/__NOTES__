Why the demo failed the test:
- I can't get the demo to show anything on the screen, despite all the amazing SVGA support (S3 Trio support issues?)
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997, Chips & Tech 65554, OPL3-SAx (Sound Blaster Pro): Crashes against actual VBE BIOS, fails to detect Sound Blaster, UNIVBE driver doesn't support chipset, SVGA modes come out as garbled text
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Can't test, no mouse, demo UI requires mouse :(
