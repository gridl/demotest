Why the demo failed the test:
- Some VGA rendering errors (mode X glitches?). Will mark as PASS if the same glitches occur on real hardware.
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997 Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA: Mode X glitch (with scroller) does not appear, though sometimes it will leave text on the screen and draw/scroll over it.
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Mode X glitch appears (with scroller), just as DOSBox-X. GUS music works.
