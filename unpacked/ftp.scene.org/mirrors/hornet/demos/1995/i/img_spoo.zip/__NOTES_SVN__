Notes:
- Demo will consistently crash with divide by zero exception, which is acknowledged by the democoders in the TXT file, if the cycle count is too high
Real hardware:
- Toshiba Laptop 1997: Demo crashes at GUS selection screen
- COMP-Old486y91, GUS, PAS: Demo ignores GUS selection, assumes port 220h, which on this unit is the Pro Audio Spectrum (GUS is on 240h), no music. Runs normally anyway, exits to DOS normally.
