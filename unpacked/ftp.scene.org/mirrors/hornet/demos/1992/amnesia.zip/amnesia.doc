                 ÄÍÍ "Amnesia" MegaDemo! - Renaissance 11/4/92 ÍÍÄ
         ÄÍÍ Demo Coded By Tran þ Awesome Music By Mosaic & C.C.Catch ÍÍÄ

Requirements:

      - 386 Processor Or Better
      - VGA Graphics
      - SoundBlaster/SoundBlaster Pro (Optional)


IMPORTANT!! - You Must NOT Have Any Expanded/Extended Memory Managers Loaded
              In Order To Run This Demo. This includes QEMM, EMM386, 386^MAX,
              and HIMEM. This is not bad coding, this is due to the fact that
              only one program can take hold of 386 32-bit Protected mode at
              one time.

This demo will attempt to automatically reboot if already in V86 Mode to save
you some time. It will reboot your computer with a clean CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT then you can reboot and your PC will be back to normal. If it does
not work, then just resort back to a plain old DOS boot disk.
