Demo requires EMS.
It also requires an FPU for some reason (PowerBasic doesn't emulate one??)

The glitching out on the title screen is the demo using PKUNZIP on DIT.DAT
to unpack it's files. The reason it glitches is because it attempts to use
CTTY to redirect the console to NUL (which doesn't work in DOSBox) and then
PKUNZIP prints text to the console (now one of the VGA planes in mode 0x13
320x200x256) and that makes the distortion you see. The fix: Implement CTTY
so the demo's CON redirection works.

The demo is marked as FAILED because Gravis ultrasound music stops working
during the transition from the first part to the animation loop (buildings
and a helicopter, zooming into a satellite dish). The music stops and the
demo never leaves the animation loop. Strange, considering I had no problems
with this demo back in 2007 running it under DOSBox 0.72.
