Why the demo failed the test:
- Don't know if this is a problem with DOSBox-X but the demo's music playback is broken.
  GUS audio sounds choppy as if it's trying to play music but it's only at half speed.
  Sound Blaster audio sounds like it's trying to play music but missing every other interrupt.
