Why the demo failed the test:
- Demo misrenders title, screen is garbled, bad bank switching support code.
- Uses A0000 to C7FFF as if a linear framebuffer (???)
- Calls VESA BIOS to set mode 0x101 non-linear framebuffer
- Appears to draw to the screen as if a linear frame-buffer starting at A0000 (????!?)
- Does not appear to pay attention to the Linear Framebuffer availabilitiy flag
- Does not appear to support window/bank switching
- Talks to VESA BIOS as if VBE1.1 (does not write VESA signature on query), allocated buffer is 256 bytes (512 byte struct would overrun adjacent text)
! PLEASE RUN THIS ON REAL HARDWARE AND EXAMINE BEHAVIOR TO DETERMINE WHERE IT WORKS AND DOESN'T WORK
