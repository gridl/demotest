REM ------ RUN THE DEMO -------
SURP_KLF.COM

# NTS: This demo terminates using INT 20h, which requires the CS value to locate the PSP segment.
#      This demo also uses the stack in a way that causes SP to wrap around from 0xFFFE to 0x0004
#      and beyond.
#
#      This demo will crash in SVN because SVN assumes it can read the CS value using SegPhys(ss) + reg_sp.
#
#      DOSBox-X has code to handle this case properly.
