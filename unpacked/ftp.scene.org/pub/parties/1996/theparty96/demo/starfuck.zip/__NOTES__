- Horrible demo! (on purpose?)

- Here's a big gotcha about the Sound Blaster menu:

  It expects you to type in the whole port number. Not just the middle
  digit like most demos, and not just "220" because that becomes decimal.
  No, you must enter the port number like "$220" (Turbo Pascal version of
  hexadecimal). The program does not range-check the port number, so if
  you enter say "$170" you can direct Sound Blaster output at your secondary
  IDE controller :)
