Some parts run on too long.

The last part plays music but shows nothing on screen.

It then exits to DOS with no visible sign of completing, which
would usually lead one to assume it crashed.

So I'm really not sure if the demo worked properly or not, or
whether or not this is how it would work on real hardware.
