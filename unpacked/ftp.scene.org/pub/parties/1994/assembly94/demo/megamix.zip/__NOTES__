Gravis Ultrasound support DOES NOT WORK

May crash during wavy rotating graphic if less than 610-620K-ish of RAM.

VERY picky about the amount of available memory! Less than 615KB or so and some parts fail outright.
More than 620KB risks the effects inherent in running DOS applications too low in memory.

Unstable demo code.

Killed the keyboard on return to DOS??
