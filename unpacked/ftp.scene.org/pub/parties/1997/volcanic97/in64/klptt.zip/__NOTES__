Why the demo failed the test:
- Uses A0000 to C7FFF as if a linear framebuffer (???)
- Calls VESA BIOS to set mode 0x101 non-linear framebuffer
- Appears to draw to the screen as if a linear frame-buffer starting at A0000 (????!?)
- Does not appear to pay attention to the Linear Framebuffer availabilitiy flag
- Does not appear to support window/bank switching
! PLEASE RUN THIS ON REAL HARDWARE AND EXAMINE BEHAVIOR TO DETERMINE WHERE IT WORKS AND DOESN'T WORK
TEST RESULTS:
- FAIL: DOSBox-X: Supports Sound Blaster Pro and 16, still doesn't talk to hardware properly
- Inconclusive: Chips & Tech 65554 SVGA: Laptop lacks GUS, but has Sound Blaster Pro. Demo requires BLASTER variable to locate Sound Blaster. If given, the demo MAY talk to the card, or it may randomly crash with an invalid opcode exception. If Sound Blaster output works, the demo may forget how to keep Sound Blaster music going after the first part, leaving the rotating dots to loop forever. Apparently the demo manages to talk to the screen properly in the first part (unlike DOSBox-X), for reasons I do not yet understand. This demo can crash randomly. It doesn't seem to be stable.
- PASS: S3 VIRGE PCI SVGA: System lacks GUS, but has Sound Blaster 16. Demo requires BLASTER variable. Demo appears to have no issues with Sound Blaster 16. Apparently the demo manages to talk to the screen properly in the first part (unlike DOSBox-X), for reasons I do not yet understand.
