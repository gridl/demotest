Demo bugs:
  - The demo seems to mask IRQ 2 (or 8) and then expect the BIOS
    to carry out INT 15h AH=86h properly. Since DOSBox relies on
    the RTC interrupt to count time, this doesn't work, and the
    demo hangs after the introductory text. DOSBox-X contains a
    fix to deal with this.

  - Very minor sound skips and stutters during the rave part
