  Assumes GUS on port 220h

Graphics:

  SVGA Mode X bug: Uses Mode X as normal, but assumes that sequencer register 0x12 is an
                   alias of the Map Mask Register (index 0x02). On older VGA hardware
                   that happens to be true, but not on newer hardware. This is why on
                   newer chipsets the demo's graphics come out blocky and low resolution
                   because it is no longer selecting Mode X bitplanes.
