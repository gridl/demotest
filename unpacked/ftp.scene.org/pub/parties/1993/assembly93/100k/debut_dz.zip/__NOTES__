Sound:
  Despite asking for GUS port demo can't seem to run music unless
  you set gusbase=220 and sbtype=none. Will pass if the demo makes
  the same mistake on real hardware.

Video:
  The graphics flicker horribly, as if the demo is trying to page
  flip but not doing it right, during the "dot cloud" parts.
  Will pass if the demo makes the same mistake on real hardware.

Release:
  This looks like an earlier release. A later, stable, working
  version of this demo can be found in ../dzdebcde.zip/
