Why the demo failed the test:
- This demo appears to unpack it's contents into a hidden temporary directory
  and run the parts from there. It appears to rely on marking the files as
  archive+system which doesn't work (of course) in DOSBox.

  Not sure if the above has anything to do with the demo failing to run about
  50% of it's parts.
