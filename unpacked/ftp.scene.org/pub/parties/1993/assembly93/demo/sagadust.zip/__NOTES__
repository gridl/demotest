Sound Blaster issues
 - Some popping and crackling is always going to happen. There's nothing you can
   do about it. It does it on real hardware too. The settings provided in dosbox.conf
   do much to mitigate most of it though.

 - Don't run with sbtype=sb16 or run on Sound Blaster 16. It will work, but you will
   hear static inbetween demo parts. The demo leaves DMA playback running while
   loading the next part and it assumes it can use "disable speaker" and "enable speaker"
   to hide it between parts, which works with SB Pro but not SB16.

"Shit bobs" speed issues
 - On real hardware the shit bobs run a lot slower. In DOSBox-X they go really fast,
   unless you add video RAM delay.

Fixed issues?
 - At one point during DOSBox-X the demo would eventually hang having read the I/O port
   from some unrelated segment (usually VGA RAM!) and then get stuck reading whatever
   random I/O port it got. As of April 2017 that doesn't seem to happen anymore!
   So far, the CS == DS IRQ hack is no longer needed.
