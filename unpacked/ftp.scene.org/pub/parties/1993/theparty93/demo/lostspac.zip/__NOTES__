There are two parts where I suspect the demo is not working right:

The "flash" after part 6 (text rising out of a boiling pot), where
what probably should be an image is garbage data.

The rotating textured cube, that flickers slightly, and more so when
fading out.

The credits section, where GUS music cuts out entirely.
