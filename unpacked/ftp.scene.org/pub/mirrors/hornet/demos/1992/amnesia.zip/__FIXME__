Frame rate issues... I thought a demo of this age would at least
try to update the screen once per vertical retrace? Analysis with DOSBox-X
shows that the scrolling text, animations, and such are not drawn
every frame, nor every other frame, but at an irregular interval.

Is DOSBox-X doing something wrong?
